NO EXTRA INFORMATION

This is a service that connects students and tutors. Our idea is to make a platform that is easily accessible for anyone who wants to become a tutor to become one. Our system will include a rating system and a way for tutors to assign homework. It will utilize an SQL database and a react front-end. This project is for the summer 2022 offering of CPSC 304 at UBC.
